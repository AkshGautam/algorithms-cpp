# Linked Lists
Linked Lists are an essential (and classic) data structure that is very simple.

## What are they?
Linked Lists are like arrays, but they don't have a set amount of space and 
inserting values is extremely easy.

## Wikipedia Defintion
Linked List - an ordered set of data elements, each containing a link to its successor (and sometimes its predecessor).

## Why use Linked Lists?
1. Dynamically Allocated - Never (unless you use all of the heap) run out of space
2. Fast Insertions - You won't have to shift all the items one way or the other
3. Building Blocks - You can immplement Stacks and Queues with a Linked List

## Some Cons
1. Slow[er] Get function - Linear Time to get items in a certain indext
2. More Memory - Linked Lists use more memory due to their usages of pointers
